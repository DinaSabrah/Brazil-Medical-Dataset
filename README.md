# No Show Medical Brazilian Dataset


we're going to explore a Brazilian medical data set for +100k patients having different ages, living in some regions in Brazil, some of the patients are hipertension, diabetec and alcoholism. Some of the patients have medical assistance called Bolsa familia; a social welfare aid program of the Government of Brazil, part of the Fome Zero network of federal assistance aid to poor Brazilian families; and if they had children, families must ensure that the children attend school and are vaccinated, Bolsa program has more activities as well. No-show column here has two entries; 'No' for patients who care about attending their medical scheduled appointments and 'Yes' for others who didn't attend their appointments. I think it's fine to know whether males or females care more about their health; attend more their medical appointments, since it's popular in most countries not only regions that females care more about their health. It's important to explore whom patients attend their medical appointments; hipertension, diabetec or alcoholism care more. Region affects patients attendance; maybe living in a specific region, perhaps its located near to the medical appointment region encourage them to attend more. Finally, i'm so curious to check if patients having Bolsa familia welfare aid encourages them to attend and care about their medical appointments.
